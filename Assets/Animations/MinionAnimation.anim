As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as Unity's .anim files. These files are created within Unity's animation editor and contain complex data structures that represent the animation of a game object. 

However, I can guide you on how to create a basic animation for a minion in Unity:

1. Open Unity and navigate to the Minion prefab in the Project window.
2. Select the Minion prefab and open the Animation window (Window > Animation > Animation).
3. Click on the "Create" button in the Animation window to create a new animation. Name it "MinionAnimation".
4. With the record button enabled (red circle), you can now manipulate the Minion's properties to create keyframes in the animation. For example, you might want to animate the Minion's position or rotation to create a walking animation.
5. Once you've finished creating the animation, click the record button again to stop recording.

The animation will be saved as "MinionAnimation.anim" in the location you specified when you created the animation.
