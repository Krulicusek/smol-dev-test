As an AI text model, I'm unable to generate binary files or Unity prefab files directly. However, I can guide you on how to create a Tower prefab in Unity.

1. First, create a new GameObject in your Unity scene, and name it "Tower".
2. Add necessary components to this GameObject. For a tower defense game, you might need components like a Sprite Renderer (for the tower's appearance), Box Collider (for detecting when enemies are in range), and a custom script (for the tower's behavior).
3. To add a Sprite Renderer, click on "Add Component" in the Inspector, then search for and select "Sprite Renderer". You can then assign the "TowerTexture.png" to the Sprite property of the Sprite Renderer.
4. To add a Box Collider, click on "Add Component" in the Inspector, then search for and select "Box Collider". Adjust the size and position of the collider to match the tower's range.
5. To add a custom script, click on "Add Component" in the Inspector, then select "New Script". Name the script "Tower" and click "Create and Add". This will create a new script named "Tower.cs" and attach it to the Tower GameObject.
6. Open the "Tower.cs" script and write your tower's behavior in it. This might include detecting when enemies are in range, attacking enemies, and interacting with the UpgradeSystem.
7. Once you've set up your Tower GameObject with all its components, you can turn it into a prefab. Simply drag the Tower GameObject from the Hierarchy into your Project window. This will create a new prefab named "Tower.prefab".

Remember, this is a general guide. Depending on your game's specific requirements, you might need to add more components or scripts to your Tower GameObject.
