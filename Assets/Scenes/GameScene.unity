Since Unity scenes (.unity) are binary files, they cannot be represented as code. They are created and edited using Unity's visual editor. However, I can provide a pseudo-code representation of what the GameScene.unity might contain:

```
// Pseudo-code for GameScene.unity

// Load necessary assets
LoadAsset("Assets/Textures/MapTexture.png");
LoadAsset("Assets/Prefabs/Tower.prefab");
LoadAsset("Assets/Prefabs/Minion.prefab");
LoadAsset("Assets/Sounds/BackgroundMusic.wav");

// Initialize controllers
InitializeObject("GameController");
InitializeObject("PlayerController");
InitializeObject("AIController");
InitializeObject("MapController");
InitializeObject("SpeedController");

// Initialize systems
InitializeObject("UpgradeSystem");
InitializeObject("SpawnSystem");

// Set up map
CallFunction("MapController", "LoadMap");

// Start background music
PlaySound("Assets/Sounds/BackgroundMusic.wav");

// Start game
CallFunction("GameController", "StartGame");
```

This pseudo-code represents the high-level operations that would be performed when the GameScene.unity scene is loaded in Unity. The actual operations would be performed by Unity's engine based on the configuration of the scene in the visual editor.
