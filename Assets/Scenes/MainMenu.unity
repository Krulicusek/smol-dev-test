As an AI, I'm unable to generate Unity scene files (.unity) as they are binary files and not text-based. They are created and managed within the Unity Editor. However, I can guide you on what components and settings you should have in your MainMenu.unity scene:

1. Create a new scene and name it "MainMenu".
2. Add a Canvas to the scene for UI elements.
3. Add a "Start Game" button to the Canvas. Attach a script to this button that calls the StartGame() function from the GameController.cs script when clicked.
4. Add an "Upgrade Menu" button to the Canvas. Attach a script to this button that loads the UpgradeMenu.unity scene when clicked.
5. Add a "Quit Game" button to the Canvas. Attach a script to this button that quits the application when clicked.
6. Add a Background Image to the Canvas and set its texture to "MapTexture.png".
7. Add an AudioSource to the scene and set its AudioClip to "BackgroundMusic.wav". Make sure it's set to loop.

Remember to save the scene and make sure it's included in the build settings.
