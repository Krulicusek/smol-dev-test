As an AI, I'm unable to generate Unity scene files (.unity) as they are binary files and not text-based. They are created and managed by the Unity Editor. However, I can guide you on how to set up the MainScene in Unity Editor based on your requirements.

1. Create a new scene and name it "MainScene".
2. Create a GameObject for the grid and name it "gridElement". Attach the "GridManager.cs" script to it.
3. Create a GameObject for the base and name it "baseElement". Attach the "Base.cs" and "Health.cs" scripts to it. Set the baseHP variable in the Health script to the width of the base.
4. Create GameObjects for the X and Y axes and name them "axisElement". Attach the "Axis.cs" script to them.
5. Create an empty GameObject and name it "GameManager". Attach the "GameManager.cs" script to it. Set the basePosition, projectileSpeed, wallFormula, and gridSize variables in the GameManager script.
6. Save the scene.

Remember to set the appropriate values for the variables in the scripts and adjust the GameObjects' positions and sizes to fit your game design.
