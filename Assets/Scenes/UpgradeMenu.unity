As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as Unity scene files (.unity). These files are not written in a programming language, but are serialized data of the Unity engine's objects and components. They contain information about game objects, components, properties, and the relationships between them, which is not feasible to generate in a text-based format.

However, I can provide a general idea of what the UpgradeMenu.unity scene might contain:

1. A Canvas for the UI elements.
2. Text elements for displaying the current level and cost of each upgrade.
3. Buttons for each upgradeable element (towers, minions, spawn rate).
4. Scripts attached to the buttons to handle the upgrade logic (likely referencing UpgradeSystem.cs).
5. A Back button to return to the main game scene.

To create and modify Unity scenes, you would use the Unity Editor's graphical interface.
