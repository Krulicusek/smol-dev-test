As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate a .wav sound file. However, I can provide a code snippet on how to use the "BackgroundMusic.wav" file in Unity using C#.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BackgroundMusic : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource audioSource;

    void Start()
    {
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        audioSource.clip = Resources.Load<AudioClip>("Sounds/BackgroundMusic");
        audioSource.loop = true;
        audioSource.Play();
    }
}
```

This script should be attached to a GameObject in your scene, and it will play the "BackgroundMusic.wav" file on loop. The "BackgroundMusic.wav" file should be placed in the "Resources/Sounds" folder in your Unity project.
