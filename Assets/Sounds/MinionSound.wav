As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate audio files such as .wav files. However, I can guide you on how to use the "MinionSound.wav" file in a Unity script. Here's an example of how you can use this sound file in a Unity C# script:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MinionSound : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource minionAudioSource;
    public AudioClip minionSoundClip;

    void Start()
    {
        minionAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        minionSoundClip = Resources.Load<AudioClip>("Assets/Sounds/MinionSound");
    }

    public void PlayMinionSound()
    {
        minionAudioSource.PlayOneShot(minionSoundClip);
    }
}
```

In this script, we first declare an AudioSource and an AudioClip. In the Start() method, we get the AudioSource component attached to the same GameObject this script is attached to, and we load the "MinionSound.wav" file from the Resources folder. The PlayMinionSound() method can be called to play the sound.
