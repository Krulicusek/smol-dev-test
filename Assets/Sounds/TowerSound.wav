As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate a .wav sound file. However, I can provide a code snippet on how to use the "TowerSound.wav" file in Unity using C#.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class TowerSound : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource towerAudioSource;

    void Start()
    {
        towerAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        towerAudioSource.clip = Resources.Load<AudioClip>("Sounds/TowerSound");
    }

    public void PlayTowerSound()
    {
        towerAudioSource.Play();
    }
}
```

This script should be attached to the tower object in Unity. It loads the "TowerSound.wav" file from the "Sounds" folder inside the "Resources" folder and plays it when the `PlayTowerSound()` method is called.
