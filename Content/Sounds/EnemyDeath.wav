As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate audio files. The file "Content/Sounds/EnemyDeath.wav" should be an audio file that plays when an enemy is defeated in the game. You should create or find a suitable sound effect, and save it as "EnemyDeath.wav" in the "Content/Sounds" directory of your project.
