As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate audio files such as .wav files. However, I can provide you with a code snippet on how to load and play this sound file in MonoGame.

```csharp
SoundEffect minionAttackSound;

// Load the sound file in your LoadContent method
protected override void LoadContent()
{
    minionAttackSound = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("Sounds/MinionAttack");
}

// Play the sound when a minion attacks
public void MinionAttack()
{
    minionAttackSound.Play();
}
```

Please replace the "MinionAttack" method with the actual method in your game where a minion attacks.
