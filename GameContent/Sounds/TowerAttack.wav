As an AI text model, I'm unable to generate a .wav sound file. However, I can provide you with a code snippet on how to load and play this sound file in MonoGame. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Declare a SoundEffect instance
SoundEffect towerAttackSound;

// In your LoadContent method, load the .wav file
towerAttackSound = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("Sounds/TowerAttack");

// To play the sound
towerAttackSound.Play();
```

Please replace the placeholder path with the actual path of your .wav file.
