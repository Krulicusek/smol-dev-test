# Snake Game

This is a simple browser-based snake game built using Blazor and C#. The UI is implemented using HTML and C#.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and open the `SnakeGame.sln` in Visual Studio.

## Building

To build the application, use the `Build` option in Visual Studio. Make sure that the game builds without any errors before you commit.

## Running

To run the application, use the `Start Debugging` option in Visual Studio. The game will open in your default web browser.

## Game Rules

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat the food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake hits the border or its own body.

## Implementation

The game logic is implemented in the `GameService.cs` file. The `Snake.cs` and `Food.cs` files define the properties of the snake and the food. The game UI is implemented in the `Game.razor` file.

## Contributing
