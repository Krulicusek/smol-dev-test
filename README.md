# MathGuardians: The Geometric Frontier

Welcome to "MathGuardians: The Geometric Frontier," an innovative tower defense game where mathematics and strategy collide. This game challenges players to defend their base using dynamically generated SVG graphics and mathematical formulas. No traditional game assets are used; instead, the game world is constructed in real-time using simple yet powerful SVG representations based on mathematical principles.

## Getting Started

To get started with "MathGuardians," you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the game directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the game server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:80` to start playing!

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Base**: Your stronghold is a circle whose health is indicated by its inner empty width.
- **Mathematical Defenses**: Create defenses using SVG graphics and mathematical formulas.
- **Learn as You Play**: Discover and apply new mathematical formulas to strengthen your defenses.
- **Upgrade System**: Enhance your defenses and unlock advanced mathematical concepts.
- **Dynamically Generated Axes**: Visual references for mathematical positioning are created in real-time.
- **Interactive Gameplay with npm**: Manage your game development environment with npm scripts.
- **Express Server & Hosting**: The game is hosted on an Express server listening on port 80.
- **Strategic Challenges**: Adapt your defenses to various projectile types.
- **Educational Element**: Integrate mathematical learning into gameplay.
- **Visualize Mathematics**: See mathematical equations shape your defenses.
- **Endless Creativity**: Experiment with SVG representations and mathematical formulas.
