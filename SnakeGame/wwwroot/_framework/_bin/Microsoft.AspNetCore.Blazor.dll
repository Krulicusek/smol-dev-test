I'm sorry for the confusion, but the file "SnakeGame/wwwroot/_framework/_bin/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.dll" is a DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) file, which is a binary file that contains compiled code. It's not possible to generate code for a DLL file as it's not a text-based file like a C# or HTML file. This file is generated automatically when you build your Blazor project in Visual Studio or using the .NET CLI.
