As an AI, I'm unable to generate binary files such as DLLs. The file "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.dll" is a pre-compiled library provided by Microsoft as part of the ASP.NET Core framework. It's not something that would be manually written or generated as part of your project. Instead, it's a dependency that your project would reference and use. It would be included in your project by adding a reference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components in your project file or via NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.
