As an AI, I'm unable to generate binary files such as DLLs. The file "Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions.dll" is a pre-compiled library provided by Microsoft, which is part of the .NET Core framework. It's not something that would be manually written or generated as part of your project. It gets included in your project when you add a reference to Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions in your project file or when you publish your project.
