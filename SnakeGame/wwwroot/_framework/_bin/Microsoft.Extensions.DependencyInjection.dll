As an AI, I'm unable to generate binary files such as DLLs. The file "Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.dll" is a pre-compiled library provided by Microsoft, which is used for dependency injection in .NET applications. It's not something that can be generated or written as it's a binary file, not a text-based source code file. You can obtain this file by creating a new Blazor project in Visual Studio or by downloading it directly from the NuGet package manager.
