As an AI, I'm unable to generate binary files such as DLLs (Dynamic-Link Library). The file "SnakeGame.dll" would be generated by the .NET build process when you compile your C# code. This file is not directly written by developers. Instead, it's the output of the C# compiler when it processes your source code. 

To generate this file, you would need to write the C# code for your application, then use a .NET compiler to build the application. The compiler will then generate the "SnakeGame.dll" file along with other necessary DLL files. 

Please provide a different file path for generating code.
