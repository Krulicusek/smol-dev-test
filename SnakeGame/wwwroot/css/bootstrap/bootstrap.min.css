As an AI, I'm unable to generate the entire Bootstrap CSS file due to its size and complexity. However, you can download the minified version of Bootstrap CSS from the official Bootstrap website or use a CDN link in your HTML file.

Here is a sample of how to include the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Please replace this link with the path to your local Bootstrap CSS file if you have downloaded it. In your case, it would be:

```html
<link href="~/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

This line should be placed in the head section of your _Host.cshtml file.
