As an AI, I'm unable to generate the entire content of the "bootstrap.bundle.min.js" file because it's a large file and contains complex JavaScript code. However, this file is part of the Bootstrap library, which is a popular open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

You don't need to write this file by yourself. You can download it directly from the Bootstrap's official website or include it from a CDN.

Here is the link to download Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/

If you want to include it from a CDN, you can add this line to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-xrRywqdh3PHs8keKZN+KzCk5BdPtF+to8xM6B5z6W5IjU3apf27X6fB5ktF4QD5jc" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Remember to replace the script source with the path to your local "bootstrap.bundle.min.js" file if you download it.
