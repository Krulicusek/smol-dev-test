1. "bluetooth_extender.py": This file will contain the main logic for extending the Bluetooth range. Shared dependencies might include the Bluetooth library (for Python, it could be PyBluez), and the functions for establishing and managing Bluetooth connections.

2. "proxy.py": This file will handle the proxy logic. It will need to import the Bluetooth library and the functions for managing connections. It will also need to share the identifiers for the devices it is proxying between.

3. "device_a.py" and "device_b.py": These files will represent the two computers in the system. They will need to import the Bluetooth library and the functions for managing connections. They will also need to share the identifiers for the devices they are connected to.

4. "controller.py": This file will represent the controller in the system. It will need to import the Bluetooth library and the functions for managing connections. It will also need to share the identifier for the device it is connected to.

5. "launch_script.py": This file will be used to launch the entire system. It will need to import all the other files and their functions. It will also need to share the identifiers for all the devices in the system.

Shared Dependencies:

- Bluetooth Library: Used across all files for Bluetooth functionality.
- Connection Management Functions: Used across all files for establishing and managing Bluetooth connections.
- Device Identifiers: Used across all files to identify the devices in the system.
- Proxy Logic: Used in "proxy.py", "device_a.py", "device_b.py", and "controller.py" to manage the proxy connection.
- Launch Function: Used in "launch_script.py" to start the entire system.
