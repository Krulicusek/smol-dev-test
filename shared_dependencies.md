4. **CSS Classes in `public/css/style.css`:**
   - `.base`: Style for the base SVG element.
   - `.barrier`: Style for the barrier SVG elements.
   - `.projectile`: Style for the projectile SVG elements.
   - `.axis`: Style for the axes SVG elements.

5. **Functions in `public/js/game.js`:**
   - `initializeGame`: Sets up the game environment.
   - `gameLoop`: The main loop that runs the game.
   - `handleCollisions`: Detects and handles collisions between projectiles and defenses.

6. **Functions in `public/js/defenses.js`:**

9. **Functions in `public/js/axes.js`:**
   - `drawAxes`: Draws the x and y axes on the SVG canvas.

10. **Functions in `public/js/mathFormulas.js`:**
    - `calculateCircle`: Calculates SVG path for a circle based on `x^2 + y^2 = r^2`.
    - `calculateLine`: Calculates SVG path for a line based on equations like `y=5`.

11. **Functions in `public/js/utilities.js`:**
    - `convertToSVGPath`: Converts a mathematical formula to an SVG path.
    - `detectCollision`: Utility function to detect collisions between SVG elements.

12. **SVG Assets in `public/assets/svg/`:**

    - `scoreChange`: Message to update the score board.
    - `upgradeApplied`: Message when an upgrade is applied.

14. **.gitignore:**
    - `node_modules/`: Ignores the npm dependencies directory.
    - `.env`: Ignores environment variables file.
    - `*.log`: Ignores log files.

15. **README.md:**
    - Contains instructions and information about the game, setup, and how to play.

These shared dependencies will be used across multiple files to ensure consistency and functionality within the game. The JavaScript files will likely export functions and possibly some constants that are used by other scripts. The SVG files will be referenced by the JavaScript to dynamically create and manipulate game elements. The CSS file will define the styles that are applied to these elements. The server file will set up the Express server and serve the static files. The `package.json` will list the project dependencies and may include scripts for running the server and other tasks.
