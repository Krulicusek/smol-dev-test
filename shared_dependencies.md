Shared Dependencies:

1. Game1: This is the main game class that is shared across all the components. It is used as a parameter in the constructors of SpawnSystem, EnemyAI, GameMap, UpgradeSystem, and SpeedControl.

2. Player: This class is shared across SpawnSystem, EnemyAI, GameMap, and UpgradeSystem. It is used as a parameter in their constructors.

3. EnemyAI: This class is shared across SpawnSystem, GameMap, and UpgradeSystem. It is used as a parameter in their constructors.

4. GameMap: This class is shared across EnemyAI and UpgradeSystem. It is used as a parameter in their constructors.

5. Tower: This class is shared across SpawnSystem and UpgradeSystem. It is used as a parameter in their constructors.

6. Minion: This class is used as a parameter in the constructor of UpgradeSystem.

7. SpeedControl: This class is used as a parameter in the constructor of EnemyAI.

8. LoadContent: This method is expected in GameMap, Player, and EnemyAI classes but is missing.

9. Update: This method is expected in SpeedControl class but is missing. It is also called with 2 arguments in Game1 class which is not supported.

10. Draw: This method is expected in Player class but is missing.

11. 'Compile' items: These are shared across all the components and are included in the project file, causing a duplication error.
